# DeltaNEAR CI Pipeline Status and Required Fixes

## Current Situation

**Date**: August 25, 2025  
**Branch**: `fix/ci-test-failures`  
**Status**: Multiple CI checks failing despite local test fixes

## Project Context

### V2.0.0 Specification Migration Completed
- **V2.0.0 Specification Freeze**: Successfully merged major breaking changes
  - Schema migration from `chain_id` to `derivatives.collateral.{chain, token}`
  - Added required `derivatives.constraints` object
  - Updated all interfaces: QuoteResponse, ExecutionResult, AcceptRequest
  - ABI hash: `67e4874cb41e405be0d3e532341adace4137cb30d59b42cb480823624bb4503f`
  - Contract deployed: `deltanear-v2-1756106334.testnet`

### Local Test Fixes Applied
- **Proto Tests**: 33/33 passing locally
- **OFA Gateway Tests**: 11/11 passing locally  
- Fixed all V1->V2 schema compatibility issues in service code
- Removed redundant scripts and maintained clean directory structure

## Current CI Pipeline Failures

Based on screenshot analysis, the following CI checks are failing:

### Failing Checks (4)
1. **CI / docker-build (pull_request)** - Failing after 18s
2. **CI / lint (pull_request)** - Failing after 8s  
3. **CI / test-contracts (pull_request)** - Failing after 17s
4. **CI / test-services (proto) (pull_request)** - Failing after 2s

### Cancelled Checks (2)
5. **CI / test-services (ofa-gateway) (pull_request)** - Cancelled after 2s
6. **CI / test-services (solver-node) (pull_request)** - Cancelled after 3s

### Skipped Checks (3)
- 3 additional skipped checks (details not visible)

## Analysis of Likely Issues

### 1. Docker Build Failure (18s failure)
**Probable Causes:**
- Docker configuration may be using outdated base images or dependencies
- Package.json changes from V2.0.0 migration may have broken Docker build process
- Missing dependencies or version conflicts in containerized environment
- Build context issues with new file structure

### 2. Lint Failure (8s failure)
**Probable Causes:**
- ESLint/TypeScript linting rules not compatible with V2.0.0 code changes
- New interface definitions may violate existing linting rules
- Import/export statements may have linting violations
- Code formatting issues in migrated service files

### 3. Contract Tests Failure (17s failure)
**Probable Causes:**
- Rust contract tests may still be using V1 test data/expectations
- Contract compilation issues with new V2.0.0 structure
- Test vectors or ABI validation failing with new schema
- Cargo.toml dependency issues or version conflicts

### 4. Proto Service Tests Failure (2s failure)
**Critical Issue:**
- Despite local tests passing (33/33), CI environment is failing quickly (2s)
- Likely environmental differences: Node.js version, package manager, or dependency resolution
- Possible issue with Jest configuration in CI environment
- Package linking issues between proto and services in CI

## Required Investigation and Fixes

### Immediate Priority Actions

#### 1. Check CI Environment Configuration
- Verify Node.js version compatibility across CI and local environments
- Check pnpm version and lockfile consistency
- Investigate workspace linking in CI environment

#### 2. Docker Build Issues
- Review Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations
- Update base images if needed
- Fix any package.json or dependency issues in Docker context

#### 3. Linting Violations  
- Run `pnpm lint` locally to identify linting issues
- Fix ESLint/TypeScript violations in service files
- Ensure code formatting is consistent

#### 4. Contract Test Environment
- Verify Rust toolchain version in CI
- Check if contract tests need V2.0.0 test data updates
- Investigate Cargo.toml and dependency compatibility

#### 5. Service Test Dependencies
- Check Jest configuration files for CI compatibility
- Verify workspace dependencies are correctly resolved in CI
- Investigate package linking between proto and services

### Files Likely Needing Attention

1. **CI Configuration**: `.github/workflows/` files
2. **Docker**: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
3. **Linting**: ESLint config, affected service files
4. **Contract Tests**: Rust test files in `contracts/near-intents-derivatives/src/`
5. **Package Configuration**: `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, Jest configs

## Current Working State

### What's Working Locally
- Proto package: All 33 tests passing
- OFA Gateway service: All 11 tests passing
- V2.0.0 schema compatibility fully implemented
- Interface migration completed successfully

### What Needs CI Environment Fixes
- Build environment configuration
- Linting rule compliance
- Contract test environment setup
- Service test environment and dependency resolution

## Next Steps for Resolution

1. **Investigate CI logs** - Get detailed failure logs for each failing check
2. **Environment parity** - Ensure CI environment matches local working setup
3. **Incremental fixes** - Address each failing check systematically
4. **Validation** - Test each fix in CI environment before proceeding to next issue

## Branch Information

- **Current Branch**: `fix/ci-test-failures`
- **PR**: https://github.com/bpolania/DeltaNEAR/pull/2
- **Base Branch**: `main` (contains V2.0.0 specification freeze)
- **Status**: Ready for CI debugging and systematic failure resolution

The local fixes are solid - the issue is environment and configuration differences between local and CI execution contexts.
